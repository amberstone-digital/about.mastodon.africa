<p>This page will be updated monthly to recap key events of the month, and the hosting costs incurred to keep Mastodon.Africa running.</p>

<h1>December 2022</h1>

<p>Main project this month was to finalize the service setup: Get everything migrated to South Africa, set up the terms/conduct rules, and prepare to open the doors "properly"</p>

<ul>
<li>16 Dec: Started registration for a dedicated AWS account under Protocol </li>
<li>19 Dec: AWS account registered and af-south-1 region activated</li>
<li>19 Dec: Instance and data migration to af-south-1 completed</li>
<li>19 Dec: about.mastodon.africa created, Vision and Mission populated, first draft of Code of Conduct</li>
<li>19 Dec: AWS CloudFront CDN enabled and configured</li>
<li>22 Dec: Code of Conduct, Terms and Conditions finalized</li>
<!--<li>22 Dec: Instance registration opened - accounts can now be created without prior approval</li>-->
</ul>

<h3>Hosting Costs</h3>

<p>This is as of 22 December 2022, and the instance is brand new, but the current breakdown of the AWS hosting bill is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>t3.medium instance (EC2): $3.20</li>
  <li>Media and backup storage (S3): $0.98</li>
  <li>DNS Hosting (Route53): $0.52</li>
  <li>Tax: $0.71</li>
  <li><strong>Total (Dec 2022): $5.41</strong></li>
</ul>

<h1>November 2022</h1>

Given the events at Twitter during the week, the case for a reliable South African-based Mastodon server basically made itself. I got an initial setup going at Hetzner EU first, under an existing hosting agreement to get up and running quickly. The plan was to eventually migrate everything to AWS Cape Town (af-south-1) and operate the service under a Pty (Ltd).

<ul>
  <li>7 Nov: mastodon.africa domain name registered</li>
  <li>7 Nov: Hosting procured at Hetzner EU, with a CPX31 VM in Germany</li>
  <li>7 Nov: Initial instance deployed at v3.5.3</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hosting Costs</h3>

<p>No hosting costs reported for November 2022, since the instance was running on existing hosting under another account.</p>
