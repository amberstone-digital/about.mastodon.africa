protocol7 is a South African-based entity with a simple mission:

<h2>Provide a platform for South Africans to participate in the digital economy.</h2>

Our belief is that the internet presents the greatest growth opportunity in history, and seeks to bridge the gap between what is currently possible, and what is accessible to the average South African.

To further this mission, protocol7 is the entity behind <a href="https://mastodon.africa">mastodon.africa</a>.
